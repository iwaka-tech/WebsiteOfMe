## Core Features:

- Bulgarian Content Pages: Dynamic display of 'About Me', 'Useful Resources', and 'Client Reviews' sections, with all content (text, dates, etc.) presented in Bulgarian.
- Secure Content Management System (CMS): An administrative portal allowing the site owner to securely create, edit, and delete all textual and media content across the personal website using a Firebase backend.
- Dynamic Video Wallpaper Selection: An admin interface within the CMS for managing a library of video files and selecting the active full-screen video background, providing a rich visual experience. The video metadata and URLs are stored via Firebase.
- AI Review Response Tool: An integrated tool within the CMS that utilizes generative AI to help the site owner draft personalized thank-you responses to client reviews, leveraging key information from the original review.
- Transparent UI Elements: Implementation of visually transparent buttons and navigation components to allow the dynamic video background to be a prominent visual feature.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme: Dark. To highlight dynamic video backgrounds and convey modern elegance.
- Primary color: Deep amethyst (#6B4D8A). A sophisticated purplish-blue for emphasis and key elements, providing a calm yet rich feel against dark backgrounds.
- Background color: Very dark purple-gray (#241D29). A heavily desaturated version of the primary hue, providing depth and a muted backdrop for video content.
- Accent color: Medium violet-blue (#7F8BF9). A brighter, more saturated blue analogous to the primary, used for interactive elements and highlights to ensure contrast and draw attention.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, slightly tech-infused and distinct look.
- Body text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for high readability, a neutral tone, and a clean, objective appearance.
- Use minimalist, outline vector icons that complement the transparent UI elements, maintaining a sleek and uncluttered aesthetic.
- Implement a full-width, responsive design with content sections overlaid on the dynamic video background. Content areas will be centered and adapt fluidly to various screen sizes.
- Subtle animations for background video transitions and on hover states for navigation links and buttons. Content elements will fade in smoothly as they load to enhance user experience.
